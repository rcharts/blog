Poirot is still under development and will be available on github shortly. It is essentially a blogging layer written on top of [slidify](http://github.com/ramnathv/slidify). Poirot uses **markdown** for text content, **knitr** for code chunks and **mustache** for templating. Poirot is highly extensible using widgets. As a publishing framework for data scientists, Poirot comes pre-equipped with support for math, visualization and tables.
